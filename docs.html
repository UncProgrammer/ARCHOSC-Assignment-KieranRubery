<p>Here I have created an assignment folder within my workspace, with a pictures folder within it.</p>
<img src="Pictures/Folder.png" alt="The original folder.">
<p>Using the command line and the command ‘git init’, I have created a local git repository within my new folder.</p>
<img src="Pictures/Git Init.png" alt="Git init on the command line.">
<p>A new online repository has been created on the Github website to match with the local repository.</p>
<img src="Pictures/Online Repo.png" alt="The initial online repository.">
<p>Through a few commands, I linked the local repository to the online repository and made it a remote repository. ‘git remote add origin’ linked the two, while ‘git pull origin main’ pulled what was on the online repository and placed it in the local one.</p>
<img src="Pictures/Remote Repo.png" alt="Creating the remote repository.">
<p>Through adding an ‘index.html’ containing some HTML code, this website was created.</p>
<img src="Pictures/Website.png" alt="The initial website.">
<p>Using ‘git status’ shows these new changes are not yet committed. Through using ‘git add .’ the changes are staged, and then through ‘git commit’ they are properly committed.</p>
<img src="Pictures/Commit.png" alt="Committing my changes.">
<p>The changes were then pushed using ‘git push’…</p>
<img src="Pictures/Push.png" alt="Pushing the changes.">
<p>…Resulting in an updated online repository.</p>
<img src="Pictures/Updated Repo.png" alt="The updated repository.">
<p>I added a CSS stylesheet to my website…</p>
<img src="Pictures/Styles.png" alt="The changed HTML code linking it to the CSS.">
<p>Changing the colours and font…</p>
<img src="Pictures/Stylesheet.png" alt="The CSS code.">
<p>Resulting in a changed website design.</p>
<img src="Pictures/Website V2.png" alt="The second version of the website.">
<p>I then added a new image to the website using the &lt;img&gt; tag…</p>
<img src="Pictures/Smiley Face Code.png" alt="The code adding my image.">
<p>Resulting in this third version of the website.</p>
<img src="Pictures/Website V3.png" alt="The third version of the website.">
<p>These changes were then uploaded to the online repository.</p>
<img src="Pictures/Updated Repo V2.png" alt="The updated repository.">
<p>The website was then deployed using Github pages…</p>
<img src="Pictures/Github Deployment.png" alt="Github deployment page.">
<p>…Allowing the website to be accessed online without needing the local files.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>In this lab I have learned how to work with Github to push, pull and maintain code, along with creating a website and customising it using HTML and CSS. This will be particularly useful in the industry as proper usage of Github is important for creating repositories that every coder in a team can access.</p>
